cryptocurrencies are just too darn unreliable. do you really trust a ledger floating around in the ether that anyone can edit? I sure don't!

  the fastcash digital economy exhibits one of the most efficient resource allocation mechanisms of the 21 century. users have the ability to buy Public Requests For Transfer, in which they set up a trust containing an initial seed of fast cash wealth. the principal of said trust then writes out a charter and solicites fastcash investments from other users. in return, the investors recieve a slice of equity of the trust.

New user sees a super stripped-down interface.
  BALANCE: 15.00


Feature ideas:


  buyable features ->
    shorter fast.plus url



  you can buy other accounts.

  make account codes shorter ->
    3 words
    randomly insert a few cryptos

  fastcash can buy badges

  cool visualization of







  canvas behind callToAction -> trail of random color currency symbols on mouse move
  all content rendered next to each other; overflow: hidden. on click, animate frame from left
  no sound. as mouse gets closer to CTA, button color rotates faster.
  as user progresses through wizard, increase tone.

Landing page pop-up
  Text - sign up now and get x fastcash!
  Button - sign up now!

Client should send message types to server. Server should validate and assign amount

User app should be mostly black and white with no special fonts. Menu items are buttons. Maybe they become flashy on hover

Users each have their own special emblem derived from their account id. They can view it from user page. It appears on landing page upon referral.

Landing background color rotates in opposite direction as button at constant speed when mouse, or based on phone xyz


Business Logic: Accounts and Addresses
  - each user has an account, which has a single store of fastcash
  - addresses are just addresses where fastcash can be sent to. each address has a principal account, which has full control over the use of the address
  - addresses have a concept of equity, where accounts can own a portion of the fastcash flow from that address.
  - each address has a url and an emblem associated with it.
  - each address costs non-trivial fastcash to set up



"drenched in wealth"


"Fastcashmoneyplus is the premier digital currency platform of the 21st century. Don't be fooled by all the talk you hear about "cryptography currencies". These are the BEST way to lose your money. They are a SCAM. Only a fool would use a "currency" that lived on a public ledger without a central point of truth. If it sounds easy to hack, that's because it is! Hackers love the idea of you storing your wealth out in the open for the whole world to see. But they hardly stand a chance when your account is protected in the digital equivalent of a locked vault! <insert picture of locked vault> Only fastcashmoneyplus, with its patent-pending digital security infrastructure is equipped to protect you AND your digital wealth.
